# quartet

Coding exercise prepared for Quartet Health.

##The Project

We'd like to see your implementation of a react app that fulfills the users stories below. We're primarily interested in your code fluency and quality of your patterns, and much less so on your design skills, but demonstrating a sense of design is a plus. Feel free to use whatever libraries you want, and don't worry about user login/authentication or any backend store. Please push your code to a github repo or reply with a tarball; make sure to include a README with instructions on how to build / deploy locally and how you approached this exercise. Comments in your source code are also encouraged.
